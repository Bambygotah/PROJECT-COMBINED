   <h1 align="center";> <u>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</u> </h1>
<p>My favourite things are the simple pleasures of life that bring me joy and happiness.

      <br> I love spending time with my family and friends, reading books, listening to music, and watching movies.

        <br>These activities help me relax and unwind after a long day.<br></p>

          <hr> I also enjoy exploring new places and trying new foods.

            <br> Traveling to different countries and experiencing different cultures is a great way to broaden my       horizons and learn new things.</br>

            <br> Trying new foods is also a fun way to experience different cultures.<br> I wold also like to share some of my major cousers I like to study and also introduce some Friends as well.</br></br></hr>
